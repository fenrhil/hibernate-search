 * TODO discuss the usefulness of the indexable model.
 *
 * Theoretically, we could skip it entirely during binding
 * and only pass java.lang.Object to the bridges when indexing.
 *
 * But if we did:
 *
 * 1. We wouldn't be able to know in advance which properties
 * of the object are going to be read, which would prevent
 * some future optimizations (when reading streams for instance,
 * or when handling ContainedIns).
 * 2. And more importantly, the bridge wouldn't be able to
 * inspect additional markers on the indexed type, such as
 * @Latitude and @Longitude for spatial bridges for instance.
 *
 * Maybe a good compromise would be to use indexable models
 * during binding, but only for type introspection, and
 * to pass java.lang.Object to the bridges when indexing?
